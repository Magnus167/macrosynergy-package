    Estimates the annualized standard deviations of portfolio, based on historic
    variances and co-variances.

    :param <pd.DataFrame> df:  standardized JPMaQS DataFrame with the necessary
        columns: 'cid', 'xcat', 'real_date' and 'value'.
        This dataframe must contain the contract-specific signals and return series.
    :param <str> sname: the name of the strategy. It must correspond to contract
        signals in the dataframe, which have the format "<cid>_<ctype>_<sname>_CSIG", and
        which are typically calculated by the function contract_signals().
    :param <list[str]> contids: list of contract identifiers in the format
        "<cid>_<ctype>". It must correspond to contract signals in the dataframe.
    :param <str> est_freq: the frequency of the volatility estimation. Default is 'm'
        for monthly. Alternatives are 'w' for business weekly, 'd' for daily, and 'q'
        for quarterly. Estimations are conducted for the end of the period.
    :param <float> dollar_per_signal: the amount of notional currency (e.g. USD) per
        contract signal value. Default is 1. The default scale has no specific meaning
        and is merely a basis for tryouts.
    :param <int> lback_periods: the number of periods to use for the lookback period
        of the volatility-targeting method. Default is 21. This passed through to
        the function `historic_portfolio_vol()`.
    :param <str> lback_meth: the method to use for the lookback period of the
        volatility-targeting method. Default is 'ma' for moving average. Alternative is
        "xma", for exponential moving average. Again this is passed through to
        the function `historic_portfolio_vol()`.
    :param <str> rstring: a general string of the return category. This identifies
        the contract returns that are required for the volatility-targeting method, based
        on the category identifier format <cid>_<ctype><rstring>_<rstring> in accordance
        with JPMaQS conventions. Default is 'XR'.
    :param <str> start: the start date of the data. Default is None, which means that
        the start date is taken from the dataframe.
    :param <str> end: the end date of the data. Default is None, which means that
        the end date is taken from the dataframe.
    :param <dict> blacklist: a dictionary of contract identifiers to exclude from
        the calculation. Default is None, which means that no contracts are excluded.


    :return: <pd.DataFrame> with the annualized standard deviations of the portfolios.
        The values are in % annualized. Values between estimation points are forward
        filled.

    N.B.: If returns in the lookback window are not available the function will replace
    them with the average of the available returns of the same contract type. If no
    returns are available for a contract type the function will reduce the lookback window
    up to a minimum of 11 days. If no returns are available for a contract type for
    at least 11 days the function returns an NaN for that date and sends a warning of all
    the dates for which this happened.
