### The User Guide

This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, begins with some
background information about Macrosynergy, then focuses on broader
instructions for getting the most out of `macrosynergy` Package.

### Background

Macrosynergy was created in August 2009 by Robert Enserro and Nikos
Makris. In January 2010, Macrosynergy launched its first investment
fund, the Macrosynergy Trading Fund, a global macro fund that grew to
peak assets under management of \$950 million. In November 2010, Gavin
Moule joined Macrosynergy. Nikos and Gavin co-managed the Trading Fund
throughout its ten year history. Over the last decade, Macrosynergy
launched and managed three other investment funds.

Ralph Sueppel joined Macrosynergy in January 2018. At that point, the
firm channelled resources to further develop the quantamental effort
first started in 2005, when Ralph, Robert, Nikos and Gavin worked
together at BlueCrest Capital.

Today Ralph and Lasse Simonsen, who joined Macrosynergy in 2016, lead
Macrosynergy's quantamental research and development effort, while
Robert remains responsible for the company's strategic business
development and operations.
