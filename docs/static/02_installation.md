# Getting Started

How to get started with the Macrosynergy package in 5-minutes.

## Installation

The easiest method for installing the package is to use the PyPI installation method:

```bash
pip install macrosynergy
```
Alternatively, we you want to install the latest development version, you can install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/macrosynergy/macrosynergy@develop
```
This extends to any branch; not just the `develop` branch.

## Usage

The package is designed to be used in conjunction with JPMaQS Quantamental Data from the J.P. Morgan DataQuery API. If you do not have access to the DataQuery API, you can still use the package with simulated data from [macrosynergy.management.simulate_quantamental_data](./macrosynergy/management/simulate_quantamental_data).
